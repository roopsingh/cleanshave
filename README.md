A command line NNTP indexer which combined with Sabnzbd and scheduling can be an NNTP PVR.

Presently you can create a config file (done for you if it doesn't exist) and then get a list of newsgroups (not saved to a file)

Next steps:
- Save the list to a file
- Get headers
- Process headers and save them (perhaps as nzbs, maybe just an index that can become nzbs)
